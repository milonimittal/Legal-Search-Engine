O R D E R It is stated in the rejoinder-affidavit that a subcommittee has been constituted by the State Government to consider the grievances of the part- time lecturers and the cases of all such persons would be considered by the sub- committee. The Minister in-charge also seems to have made a statement to that effect on the floor of the House. If that is so, it would be open to the petitioners to make a representation before the sub-committee along with all other persons similarly situated.
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
