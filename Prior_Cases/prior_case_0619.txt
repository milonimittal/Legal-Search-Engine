CITATION: 1994 AIR 2771 1994 SCC (6) 314 1994 SCALE (4)5
ORDER 1.We are far from satisfied about the manner in which the direction of this Court has been dealt with. It is not disclosed as to what effort was made by The State Government for providing accommodation to judicial officers in the State. Nothing has been mentioned in the affidavit filed by the Deputy Secretary of the Legal Department as to what steps were taken immediately after this Court's order to ensure implementation of its directions within the time- frame fixed by the Court. The statement in the affidavit to the effect 728 "taking into consideration the instruction of the Supreme Court for direction of Judicial Officers quarters" (emphasis supplied) seems to convey that the State Government treats it as a mere instruction. Unless the necessary materials are placed before this Court as to what action the State Government took to implement the Court's direction within the time-frame, we cannot extend the time. We would, therefore, like the Chief Secretary of the State to file an affidavit in this behalf and to inform us of the period within which the direction will be complied with. Let a copy of this order be given to the State counsel for transmission to the Chief Secretary.
2\. Let this IA come up on 9-5-1994.
