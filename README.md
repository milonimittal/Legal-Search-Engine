# Just-Justice :scroll:
Referencing and researching past judgments is an important step in filing, fighting, or deciding a case. Just-Justice eliminates the need of sifting physically through the millions of documents available based on established law and legal proceedings and presents the users the top documents for any query they type! We believe that  Just-Justice can help everyone from Judges and Lawyers to citizens of our country. Lawyers would find it easy to research from existing case documents. By automating the process, their efficiency would be increased. Judges can stay ahead of the game by retrieving information about past judgments by date, geographical area, and other tags and other relevant details at a glance. By looking at past cases, judgments and related cases in their area, Citizens can make an informed decision before filing a case.
